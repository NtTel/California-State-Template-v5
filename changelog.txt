v5.6.0
        
Framework and components updates:
- Removed jQuery dependency and jQuery plugins.
- Updated Bootstrap to v5.1.3.
- Removed some jQuery dependent components such as: owl-carousels and slideshows (replaced with the native Bootstrap carousel), service tiles, and panes.
- Converted the following jQuery components to Vanilla JS: accordion, accordion list, fixed header, navigation, number counter, parallax, search, site settings, and tabs.
- Updated Bootstrap's collapse/expand data toggle attributes in collapse buttons and modals throughout the site. (For example, changed data-toggle="collapse" to data-bs-toggle="collapse", changed data-toggle="modal" to data-bs-toggle="modal".)
- Completely changed the accordion structure and code. It is now using the California Design System's accordion script.
- Updated side navigation structure to work with the new accordion component.
- Removed jQuery owl-carousels and slideshows and replaced them with the native Bootstrap carousel. 

Layout and structure updates:
- Added featured search header and icon-less navigation layout to every sample page. (Old v5.5 header and navigation layout are still in the navigation samples.)
- Updated badge classes to reflect new Bootstrap 5 markup (changed "label" class to "badge").
- Replaced outdated grid classes with the native Bootstrap grid classes. (For example, changed "group" class to "row", or "quarter" to "col-md-3".)
- Updated main banner height property (removed jQuery calculation and replaced it with pure CSS properties).
