    <h2>Get the UI kit</h2>
    <p>
      We provide a UI kit in Figma so you can prototype your department website or projects. Our kit has a library of elements that are ready to go when you need them. You save time because you don’t have to build or scour the internet for items. This helps you:
    </p>

    <ul class="m-b-md">
      <li>Quickly and easily use existing components, typography, and colors for your project</li>
      <li>Review and receive approval for a design/concept</li>
      <li>Communicate expectations with your developer</li>
      <li>QA/validate after something is developed</li>
    </ul>

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="/images/State-Template-UI-Kit.zip">Download the UI kit</a>

    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, you can start prototyping. Here are a couple of tasks you need to do first.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="bold">Create an account:</span> To use Figma, you have to have an account. You can create a free account or your department can purchase a paid account. </li>
      <li><span class="bold">Log into Figma:</span> You can either use Figma in your browser or you can download a desktop version.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Download, import, and open the UI kit: </span> In Figma, select Import on the file you downloaded. Review the different pages in the kit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Figma allows everyone to have a free account (limited options but you’re still able to use the UI kit and prototype). There are also team and enterprise accounts. Check with your department about using Figma.</p>

    <p>The UI kit provides more detail on how to use the kit.</p>

    <p>You can also download these icons.</p>
 

    <h2>Starter site prototype</h2>
    <p>
      In the kit, we also provide a starter site. It has all the basic items a department usually needs to create a website. Page templates include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Homepage</li>
      <li>Contact us</li>
      <li>About us</li>
      <li>2 landing page templates</li>
      <li>Careers</li>
      <li>Newsroom</li>
    </ul>
<p>&hellip and more!</p>
