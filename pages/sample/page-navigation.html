<h1>Page navigation</h1>
<p>Page navigation is a list of links to the current page sections or to other web pages. It is placed at the
    top of
    the page on the left. Page navigation makes it easy to see what content is available.
</p>
<h2>List navigation</h2>
<p>List navigation displays links to the webpages that can be tied into one content category, such as list
    of web components, for example. Links with class
    <code>active</code> will indicate the currently open page, which allows people to scan a page and know if
    they’re in the right place.
